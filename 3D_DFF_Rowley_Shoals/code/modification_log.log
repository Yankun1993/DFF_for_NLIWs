	1)  优化sponge边界代码，仅当spongeThinknessN/S/E/W>0时对响应边界使用sponge边界方案
2013-07-14:
    1) set speed up time (can not be used when Orlanski is open)
		This part of codes are only applied for u/v. They are not applied for W/T/S or the others.
		
        C set launch time, boundary u/v will be 0 at 0s, and increased linearly to what it should 
		C    be according to prescribe/tide params at launchtime.
		C In simple word, boundary from tide and prescribe will be set to 
		C    (mytime/launchtime)*u0 when mytime < launch_time, or u0 when mytime > launch_time,
		C    u0 is what u used to be in original MITgcm codes.
		C
		C    !NOTICE: This is only used for tide or prescribe u/v, sponge/steven/Orlanski/balance/ice
		C    will not be influenced.
		C
		C    ! launch_time should be set to -1 when it is useless
		
		


old work： 
	1) give u\v tidal speed at all open boundary
    2) give difference sponge boundary params for E/W/S/N boundary
	3)
